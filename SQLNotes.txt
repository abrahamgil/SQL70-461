SQL Diagram
	Make sure it has an owner
	Can manipulate and even add tables/data from there
	
What are Objects?
	Tables, Stored Procedures, Indexes, Views etc. All are object.
	Structure that is used to create specific instances of the object. Each object has properties

Understanding Tables
	Tables are used to store data
	Tables have specific number of columns
		each column stores a certain type of data
	Table can have an almost unlimited number of rows
		space, manageability, organization, etc

Understanding Data Integrity
	Correctness, Consistency, and uniqueness of data stored in a tables/data
	Make sure we don't store duplicate
	Data Integrity is handled:
		Row Level
			Primary Key
		Column Level
			Data Types
			Constraints

Understanding Data Types
	Use the correct type of data for the designated column
	also prevents garbage data 
	more than 30 data types in SQL Server 2012 (categories following)
		Exact numeric
		Approximate numeric
		Date and time
		character strings
		unicode character strings
		Binary Strings
		Other Data types

Understanding Primary Keys
	Used to insure that none of the rows are duplicates
	You can place primary keys on 2 columns
	
Understanding Constraints
	a Data type that has more knobs we can control. (Supercharged data type)
	4 of them
		Primary Key
			uniquely identifies each row in a tables
		Foreign keys
			Establishes and enforces a link between the data in two table to control data that can be stored in the foreign key tables
			Usually tied to the Primary key
		Check 
			limits the values that are accepted by one or more columns
			multiple CHECK constraints can be applied to a single column
		Unique
			Make sure that no duplicate values are entered in specific columns that do not participate in a primary key (usernames)

Understand NULL
	NULL does NOT mean
		Zero
		Empty
		Space
	NULL means one thing
		Unknown
	How do we dill with this NULL in a query
		We can't run a select WHERE level=NULL
		We can run a SELECT statement WHERE Level IS NULL (or IS NOT NULL)

Understanding View
	Provides predetermined data of table	
	provides ability to query from a table but only from specified columns
	
Understanding Stored Procedures
	SQL version of a subroutine
		write collection of code
		give code a name
		code and execute
	Advantages
		Stored procedure is an object
			so we can give permission and execute
		Functionality is centralized and consistent
			code changes happen in one place
		Stored procedures run more efficiently than standard queries

Understanding Triggers
	Stored procedure that executes automatically
		Whenever an update delete or insert executes the stored procedure
	
Understanding Synonyms
	an alternative name for a database object
		object can exist on a local or remote server
	Advantage - Simplifies object naming especially on remote servers and provides a layer of abstraction that protects a client application from changes made to the name or location of the base object
